# Project Scope: Inventory-Pro

## 1. Project Vision

To create a highly dynamic, low-code inventory management module that serves as the foundational component of a larger, AI-powered, multi-tenant SaaS ERP system. The system will be flexible enough to be used by any type of organization, regardless of the complexity of its inventory.

## 2. Core Features (Minimum Viable Product - MVP)

### 2.1. Dynamic Schema Builder (The "Low-Code" Core)
-   **Tenant-Specific Models:** Allow each tenant (organization) to define their own custom data fields for inventory items via a user-friendly interface.
-   **Field Types:** Support for common field types (Text, Number, Date, True/False, Dropdown List).
-   **Dynamic Forms:** The UI for creating and editing items must dynamically render forms based on the schema defined by the tenant.

### 2.2. Core Inventory Management
-   **CRUD Operations:** Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for inventory items.
-   **Stock Management:** Track stock levels across multiple locations (e.g., Warehouse A, Store B).
-   **Locations:** Ability to define and manage different stock locations.
-   **Inventory Movements:** Log all stock movements (e.g., transfer from Warehouse A to Store B, sale, spoilage).

### 2.3. Multi-Tenancy & Security
-   **Tenant Isolation:** All data must be strictly segregated by tenant. A user from Organization A must never see data from Organization B.
-   **User Management:** Tenants can invite and manage their own users.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Basic roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Staff) with predefined permissions for accessing and modifying inventory data.

### 2.4. API-First Architecture
-   A comprehensive RESTful API will be built to handle all application logic, ensuring the frontend is fully decoupled from the backend.
-   The API will include clear versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/`).
-   Interactive API documentation will be automatically generated (a benefit of Django REST Framework).

## 3. AI Features (Phase 2)

These features will be built on top of the MVP core.

-   **Demand Forecasting:** Use historical sales and inventory data to predict future stock requirements.
-   **Automated Product Categorization:** Use NLP on product descriptions and Computer Vision on product images to suggest categories.
-   **Intelligent Search:** A natural language search bar allowing users to query their inventory (e.g., "find all laptops with less than 5 units in the main warehouse").
-   **Anomaly Detection:** Automatically flag unusual events, such as a sudden spike in returns for a specific item or a product that has stopped selling.

---

## 4. Technology Stack

-   **Backend:** Python with Django & Django REST Framework (DRF).
-   **Frontend:** TypeScript with React & Next.js.
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL (leveraging the `JSONB` field for dynamic schemas).
-   **Asynchronous Tasks & AI Jobs:** Celery with Redis as the message broker.
-   **API Communication:** RESTful APIs.

## 5. Out of Scope (for MVP)

-   Direct third-party integrations (e.g., Shopify, FedEx, Stripe). The architecture will be designed to be "pluggable" to support these in the future.
-   Advanced, customizable reporting and analytics dashboards.
-   Other ERP modules like HR, Accounting, or CRM.
